Movie Browser Web Application
Project Description
The Movie Browser is a web application designed to allow users to browse, search, and filter movies from a public movie API. Users can also save their favorite movies locally. The application is built with responsiveness and accessibility in mind, ensuring a seamless experience across devices and for users with disabilities.
Features
1. Responsive, Mobile-First UI

2. Movie Data Integration
* Utilizes the TMDB API (or other public movie APIs) to fetch movie data. 
* Displays movie titles, poster images, and release years on the homepage. 
3. Search Functionality
* Dynamic search feature allowing users to search for movies by title. 
* Search results update in real-time as users type. 
4. Infinite Scrolling
* Implements infinite scrolling to handle large numbers of search results without relying on third-party libraries. 
5. Advanced Filtering Options (Optional)
* Filters movies by genre, release year range, and rating range. 
* Filters dynamically update the list of displayed movies. 
6. Favorite Movies (Optional)
* Allows users to save favorite movies locally using browser storage (localStorage). 
* Users can view and manage their favorite movies. 
7. Accessibility and SEO
* Follows accessibility best practices to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities. 
* SEO-friendly implementation to improve visibility in search engines.
